    <h1> Healthy Fruits That Are Super Nutritious </h1>
    <p>“An apple a day keeps the doctor away,” or so the saying goes.<br><br>

        Healthcare professionals know that fruit is a highly nutritious, delicious, and convenient addition to any diet. With more than 2,000 varieties of fruit available, you may wonder which ones you should pick.
        
        Each type of fruit brings its own unique set of nutrients and benefits to the table. The key is to eat fruits of various colors, as each color provides adifferent set of healthy nutrients</p>

        <h2> BANANAS. </h2>
        <p> he benefits of bananas go beyond their potassium content. Along with providing 7% of the Daily Value (DV) for potassium, bananas contain (15Trusted Source):
            <ul>
                <li> Vitamin B6: 27% of the DV</li>
                <li> Vitamin C: 12% of the DV</li>
                <li>  Magnesium: 8% of the DV</li>
            </ul>
            In addition, they offer a wide variety of plant compounds called polyphenols and phytosterols, both of which support your overall health. Furthermore, they’re high in prebiotics, a type of fiber that promotes the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source, 19Trusted Source).
            
            Note that green, unripe bananas are higher in resistant starch than ripe ones, and they’re a good source of the dietary fiber pectin. Both of these have been linked to a number of health benefits, including improved blood sugar control and better digestive health</p>

        <h2> APPLES.</h2>
        <p>One of the most popular fruits, apples are chock-full of nutrition.

        They’re rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, such as pectin, hemicellulose, and cellulose. These help you manage your blood sugar levels, promote good digestion, and support gut and heart health (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).
            
        In addition, they’re a good source of vitamin C and plant polyphenols, which are disease-fighting compounds found in plants. In fact, consuming apples regularly may lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, cancer, overweight, obesity, and neurological disorders  </p>
